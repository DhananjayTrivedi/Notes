1. Data Model :

    1. Entities
        - Model Classes for Database
        - They Have subtype also
            - For parent to access child fields, we need to TypeCase using 'as' keyword, VICE VERSA
            - All subtypes are stored in one table
    
    2. Entity Fields
    
        - Single property name is called Entity Field, which holds the state
        - It has 4 Data Types
            - Data
                    * A String, DateTime, Boolean, Integer
                    * Virutal and Physical Datafield
        
            - Foriegn Key
                    * Stores a reference to related Object
            
            - Array Key
                    * Stores a reference to set of related objects to data model
                     {Stores set of related Data Fields}
            
            - Type Key
                    * Stores the refernce to TypeList in an Entity
                            
        
    3. TypeLists
    
        - Typelist is like a drop down listt
                                * TypeCode is one particular value/row
                                * Typelist consists of TypeCode
